Welcome to Neural Notes


![Banner](images/banner.png){ height=500px }

Hi, Iâ€™m a data scientist with a deep curiosity for both data and science. I started this blog as a personal learning space â€” a place to explore new ideas, share what Iâ€™m discovering, and grow along the way.

Neural Notes isnâ€™t just a collection of posts â€” itâ€™s my digital lab notebook. I'm learning in public, and Iâ€™d love to learn with you.

If you're reading any of my posts, feel free to share your thoughts, suggestions, or corrections. Your feedback helps me improve â€” and maybe together, we can all get a little better at this data game.

Letâ€™s explore, experiment, and evolve â€” one post at a time.

## About Me

I work across the stack of data science â€” from exploring raw data to building machine learning models, analyzing fraud, experimenting with LLMs, and writing code in both Python and R. I enjoy solving real-world problems, especially the messy ones.

This blog is my personal space to learn, reflect, and grow â€” not just as a professional, but as someone genuinely curious about data, systems, and how they shape our world.

Outside of work, I like exploring music (especially metal ðŸŽ¸), building side projects, and occasionally getting lost in thought over coffee and code.

Thanks for stopping by. I hope you find something here that sparks your own curiosity.

## What Youâ€™ll Find Here

This blog is where I document what Iâ€™m learning and building, including:
- End-to-end machine learning projects
- Data science tools and tips in Python & R
- Thoughts on LLMs, model interpretability, and experimentation
- Side projects, visuals, and experiments

## Tools I Often Use

- Programming: Python, R, SQL
- ML & AI: scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, TensorFlow, Keras, transformers
- Visualization: ggplot2, matplotlib, seaborn, Plotly
- Platforms: Jupyter, RStudio, Streamlit, Shiny, MLflow, FastAPI
