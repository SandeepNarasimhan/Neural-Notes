Iâ€™m learning in public, and Iâ€™d love to learn with you.\nIf youâ€™re reading any of my posts, feel free to share your thoughts, suggestions, or corrections.

    "section": "About Me",
    "text": "About Me\nHi, Iâ€™m Sandeep, a data scientist from Mysore, India, with over 8 years of experience turning questions into insights and models into impact.\nI work across the stack of data science â€” from exploring raw data to building machine learning models, analyzing fraud, experimenting with LLMs, and writing code in both Python and R. I enjoy solving real-world problems, especially the messy ones.\nThis blog is my personal space to learn, reflect, and grow â€” not just as a professional, but as someone genuinely curious about data, systems, and how they shape our world.\nOutside of work, I like exploring music (especially metal ðŸŽ¸), building side projects, and occasionally getting lost in thought over coffee and code.\nThanks for stopping by. I hope you find something here that sparks your own curiosity."
